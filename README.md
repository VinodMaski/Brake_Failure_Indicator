Features
* Monitors brake fluid levels using a soil moisture sensor
* Detects faults in hydraulic brake pipes (brake wire breaks).
* Notifies users through an LCD display and a web interface.

Prerequisites

Arduino Setup
To set up the Brake Failure Indicator, you'll need:

* Arduino IDE installed on your computer
* Arduino board compatible with the project requirements.
* Soil moisture sensor
* Necessary hardware for simulating brake wire representation.

Installation

Development Boards Configuration
